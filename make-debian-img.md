ah shit... can't do it here lol

"what OS are you running?" I'm using Alpine

I guess I'll bust out my pinephone pro again

well that was not helpful, not sure if I'm supposed to be running Debian to make a Debian image.

I'm loading up QEMU on my x64 Win 10 desktop, so I can load an Arm64 Debian host.
