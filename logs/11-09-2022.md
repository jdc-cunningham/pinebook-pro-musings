Working with one screen sucks or at least one small screen.

I'm used to left-right configuration, code on left and whatever on right.

But I think with i3 I can do full screen/use tabbing to switch.

But right now I don't have it setup, i3 is not working on my PostmarketOS.

I am thinking about building this debian image and installing it on PBP... why not I would rather have an apt-based package manager.

A neat project would be to bridge the Pinephone (or any phone I guess) as a mouse to this. I think KDE already has this feature.

It's funny it sounds cool but when you see it working you're like "ehh..."

Anyway I'll get my Carbon X1 out for the image build above.

I am tracking the battery life of this computer, need to get a current draw if it supports something like powertop/stat.

Well... I have to compile it here due to needing Arm64 environment crap

Means slow... oh well, put those cores to work.

I'll work on my personal app then in the mean time which uses ReactJS

Back here... ask yourself, are you crazy?

I'm looking to emulate Arm64 with Qemu since I need that kind of environment to build this image.

Not sure if it'll succeed.

I need to get my terminology straight between OS/DE/architecture
