Working with one screen sucks or at least one small screen.

I'm used to left-right configuration, code on left and whatever on right.

But I think with i3 I can do full screen/use tabbing to switch.

But right now I don't have it setup, i3 is not working on my PostmarketOS.

I am thinking about building this debian image and installing it on PBP... why not I would rather have an apt-based package manager.

A neat project would be to bridge the Pinephone (or any phone I guess) as a mouse to this. I think KDE already has this feature.

It's funny it sounds cool but when you see it working you're like "ehh..."

Anyway I'll get my Carbon X1 out for the image build above.

I am tracking the battery life of this computer, need to get a current draw if it supports something like powertop/stat.
