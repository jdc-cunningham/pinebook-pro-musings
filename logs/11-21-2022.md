Finally got Tow-boot on this thing was not that hard thanks for a post on Pine64 Forum

Means Manjaro Arm works out of the box (boots)

I am just setting everything up for development on the eMMC.

More things are working here than Debian at the moment/time I'm willing to invest, for example sound.

Anyway I'm still not using this laptop a lot, trying to though.
