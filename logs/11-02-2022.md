Why did I buy this?

I know that it is obsolete... I mean it was "new" 2 years ago and at that point the SoC was old from the start.

I believe it is the same board as the Pinephone Pro but not thermally capped/20% better

Anyway... just me being a consumer pos, feeling giddy about buying things

Will it resolve in regret idk... but I'm down to get into it/hopefully learn and contribute to the platform

I'm writing this entry right now from a Lenovo Carbon X1 Gen 5 that sh*ts on the PBP... anyway

Yeah I do like the sytle of that laptop but I know once I get it the desire/want factor will die off

But the 4GB of RAM that's what I was using back in 2014.

Part of me thinks it can be nice to be reduced/focused... I have so many windows/tabs open on my desktop

And then I lose track of which YT tab is what but first world problems as they say

I should have this device sometime this week, got confirmation it shipped/on its way

Pretty fast turn around, got it shipped within 2 days of ordering it
