Notes for tomorrow

- do the physical stuff first (measure/design/print)
- remove old data/os on RPi
- flash debian, might as well add DE
- do the debian image builder guide

Using Raspberry Pi Imager Full 64bit debian bullseye with RPi 4

cloned this

https://github.com/pyavitz/debian-image-builder

cd into it, run `./install.sh`

waiting... says 20-30mins but keeps fluctuating

took about 30 minutes to finish

ran `make config`

filled in information, set `network manager to 1`

then ran

`make all board=pinebookpro`

they have a discord/I'm getting help

started going 7 mins in so far plus stopwatch

2hrs later still going

speeds up when getting to LD vs. CC

3hrs compile is done but I had a type in the userdata file nice

designed the part

booted into debian thanks to debian-image-builder

only thing I've noticed across different os's/distros is no audio output on pinebook pro speakers

which is not a big deal but interesting

I measured 9.84 watts with powertop, doing normal things

9600mAh damn... 36.48 Wh is not a lot

Yeah the 3-4 hour battery life at that rate is accurate

the battery is single cell that's why

could probably stick more batteries in there

ehh I know you can lower cpu

I'm re doing my install... it's possible I may just stick with Debian on SD card anyway so can plan to do work out of there.

seems like I'll have to mess with Tow-boot... a question of messing with the PBP or just use it

Yeah I can keep a working SD card and mess around in the future
